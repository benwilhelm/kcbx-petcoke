<h1>What is petcoke?</h1>

<p>
  Petcoke is a fine black carbon-based product of petroleum processing. When the wind is above 15 miles per hour, fine petcoke particles can become airborne, causing damage to your heart and lungs. KCBX Terminals maintains several large open-air stockpiles of petcoke on the far Southeast side of Chicago. <a href="/take-action#more-information">Learn more below.</a>

<h1>What can I do?</h1>

<p class="prominent">Demand <strong>action</strong> from Mayor Emanuel!</p>

<p>Call the Mayor's office now and demand <strong>ZERO PETCOKE THROUGHPUT</strong> at the <strong>SOUTH Terminal</strong> of KCBX Terminals. The City recently announced zero throughput at the North Terminal, but <strong>the North Terminal was already slated to close in June</strong>. Demand no petcoke through the South terminal as well.</p>

<p><strong>Already called?</strong> Great! Call again! By calling every time you receive a wind alert (or any other time) you help to create a consistent voice that the Mayor must address.</p>

<h2>What should I say?</h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>
    I'm calling to demand that the Department of Planning and Development recommend a petcoke throughput limit of ZERO for ALL TERMINALS at KCBX. The city has recently announced zero throughput at the North terminal, but that terminal was already slated to close in June. We demand a limit of zero on ALL TERMINALS at KCBX.

  <p>
    The American Cancer Society, Harvard University, and the EPA have determined that prolonged exposure to fine airborne dust particles, including petcoke, can lead to heart disease and lung disease, and this hazard must be eliminated from our community.

    ...The size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Small particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter pose the greatest problems, because they can get deep into your lungs, and some may even get into your bloodstream. Exposure to such particles can affect both your lungs and your heart...

    ...<strong>Long-term exposures</strong>, such as those experienced by people living for many years in areas with high particle levels, have been associated with problems such as reduced lung function and the development of chronic bronchitis&mdash;and even premature death...

  In addition, a <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22456598' target='_blank'>long term study by Harvard University</a> followed particulate matter levels in six cities over 35 years. The study found that increased levels of fine particulate matter in the air was associated with increased risk of mortality, especially cardiovascular and lung cancer mortality. The paper concludes <strong>"...further public policy efforts that reduce fine particulate matter air pollution are likely to have continuing public health benefits."</strong>
